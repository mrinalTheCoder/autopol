#### National Public School, HSR
All over India, thousands of accidents occur every minute due to misjudgment by the driver. AutoPol eliminates this possibility using cutting edge Computer Vision technology. To sweeten the deal, it requires no external hardware except your phone. AutoPol uses the phone’s camera to detect potential threats to the health and safety of the automobile and the driver, on the road ahead. It also detects your speed and discerns the probability of you colliding with an obstacle, hence alerting you and saving you and your automobile’s health. To implement this project, we have used python, specifically tensor flow and keras for the neural network. To design this application we have used Android Studio. AutoPol has a huge impact, saving thousands of lives. The app is simple to use and helps the driver in many ways. It is built to check the distance between you and an object, and your relative speeds. AutoPol helps in gauging whether the driver in concern, is under the influence of narcotics or alcohol, or is drowsy via a convolutional network. If so, a high pitched alarm echoes from the phone. It advises the driver to immediately rest and pull the car over. This saves many lives, including the fellow drivers on the road. AutoPol: Drive safe, and drive safe!
